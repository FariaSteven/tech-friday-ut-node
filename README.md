# Tech Friday

This repo contains the source code used to demonstrate unit tests on node.js with Mocha, Sinon and Chai that was presented during my IGTV series "Tech Friday".

`npm i` to install all npm packages.

`npm run dev` to run a dev instance with nodemon that watches files for changes and restarts the application.

`npm start` to simply start the application.

`npm test` to run tests.
